- 👋 Hi, I’m Marouan El Ouardi 4th Year Engineering Student at The Moroccan School of Engineering Sciences: IT Development(2nd year in engineering cycle).
       Since I was a kid, I always had the passion to discover things, first I used to disassemble my toys in order to look what's inside them and understand how they work, and when I got a little bit older, I loved video games, internet, and everything related to computers, electronics and technology, I wanted to understand how this things work either, and to participate in this big world. I found this in Software engineering, the passion to learn new things and understand the mechanisms of everything related to computers.
       I'm always open to learn new skills, new abilities, and trying to be a part of this electronic world.
